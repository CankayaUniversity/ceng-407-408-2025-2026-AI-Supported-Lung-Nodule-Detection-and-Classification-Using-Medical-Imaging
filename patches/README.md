# Patch Archive (Proposals Only)

This directory contains **proposal patches** created during experimentation.

## Important Notes
- These patches **do not modify** the core model.
- The core model is maintained exclusively in `ai/Pulmo` by **Furkan (fc63)**.
- Patches are archived here to:
  - preserve experimental work,
  - enable transparent review,
  - allow optional future integration.

## Workflow
1. Proposals are added here as `.patch` files.
2. Each patch clearly records:
   - original author,
   - source commit,
   - purpose of the proposal.
3. Integration into the core model is **optional** and happens only after review.

## Status
Patches in this directory are **not part of the production model**.
